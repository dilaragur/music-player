# Music Player
This project is a simple web-based music player designed to play audio files with basic controls. It features a clean and responsive interface with the following functionalities:

- Play/Pause Toggle: Users can play or pause the music using a play/pause button. The button icon dynamically changes based on the current state of the player.
- Progress Bar: A range input allows users to see and adjust the progress of the song. The progress bar updates in real-time as the song plays.
- Navigation Controls: Includes backward and forward buttons for navigation, though their functionality is not implemented in this version.
